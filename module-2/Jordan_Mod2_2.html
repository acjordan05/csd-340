        <h2>Chapter One: About Me</h2>

        <p class="intro">
    My name is Aysa and I'm a college student pursuing a B.S. in Software Development, as well as as a B.S. in Psychology with a pre-medicine focus. I grew up in a small town in Louisiana that because of limited academic opportunities helped me gain a drive to learn. In high school, I went to a boarding school that was on a college campus that allowed me take college level coursework as well as an associate degree. This experience helped me shape and advance my academic goals.
</p>

<p>
    In my free time, I enjoy relaxing and working on creative hobbies.
    <span class="sentence">Crocheting is one activity that helps me focus and unwind.</span>
   I mainly enjoy crocheting clothes or things for my dog. Additionally, I also enjoy listening to music and watching commentary YouTube. It helps me wind down and have a break from school and work.
</p>

<p>
    One of my long-term goals is to pursue a career that combines problem-solving with meaningful impact. As an INTJ, I am naturally drawn to structured, analytical fields that require strategic thinking, which is why I am interested in either radiology or software development. Both paths allow me to work independently, analyze complex information, and contribute to solutions that have real-world significance.
</p>

<p>
    I value continuous growth and try to challenge myself both academically and personally. Balancing demanding coursework with work and personal responsibilities has taught me discipline and time management. These experiences have helped shape my work ethic and prepare me for the expectations of a professional career.
